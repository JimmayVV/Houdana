                    <p class="text-justify">Houdana brought his close up magic to our middle school/high school event and proved to be exactly what I was hoping for!  His price range worked for our budget and he was highly professional.  He initiated contact with me, was easy to talk with, and made sure that all of my questions were answered.  He double checked location and times and came early to the event pepared and ready to go.  It was a worry free experience.  His close up magic highly impressed both students and adults.  Houdana did it all in the context of a dimly lit noisy roller skating rink.  A true experienced professional<br><strong>- Darren C, 4/30/16</strong></p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Thank you for everything! All the kids and adults enjoyed the show so much! My daughter is still talking about the show everyday. Thank you again!<br><strong>- T. G., 12/13/2014, Birthday Party, Raymond, NH</strong></p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Good afternoon Mr. Houdana. My husband and I would like to thank you and your wife for your performance. You two have made this birthday party a memorable one! Thank you and God bless.
