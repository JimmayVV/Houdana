                    <p dir="ltr">Houdana brought his close up magic to our middle school/high school event and proved to be exactly what I was hoping for!  His price range worked for our budget and he was highly professional.  He initiated contact with me, was easy to talk with, and made sure that all of my questions were answered.  He double checked location and times and came early to the event pepared and ready to go.  It was a worry free experience.  His close up magic highly impressed both students and adults.  Houdana did it all in the context of a dimly lit noisy roller skating rink.  A true experienced professional<br />

<p>Thank you for everything! All the kids and adults enjoyed the show so much! My daughter is still talking about the show everyday. Thank you again!<br />

<p>The Houdana magic show brought laughs and a wow-factor to my 6 year old&#8217;s birthday party.  Its a great value and a lot of fun.<br />
<strong>- Rane, 8/11/2012, Birthday Party, Manchester, NH</strong></p>
<p>Everyone raved about the show. We were truly entertained the entire time. It really was a show that kids of, literally, all ages would love. You both did a wonderful job. I am very impressed. I will certainly pass along your info. Take care and thank you again for making my son&#8217;s 5th birthday a special one.<br />
