Houdana, the magician, was in need of a website to direct clients and perspective clients to, and I was more than happy to provide a basic website to support his needs. Over the years there have been minor changes to the layout and content, but in the end of 2016 the site was converted to Bootstrap, and pushed to Github for use of their free Github Pages program.

Due to the service Github offers, this repository can be found on my profile with Github.
